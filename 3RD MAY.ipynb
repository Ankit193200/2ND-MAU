    "# Q1. Role of Feature Selection in Anomaly Detection:\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature selection is crucial in anomaly detection as it helps identify relevant features that distinguish normal and anomalous instances.\n",
    "Selecting the right set of features can improve the efficiency and accuracy of anomaly detection algorithms.\n",
    "It reduces the dimensionality of the data, focusing on the most informative features.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q2. Evaluation Metrics for Anomaly Detection:\n",
    "\n",
    "True Positives (TP): Anomalies correctly identified.\n",
    "False Positives (FP): Normal instances incorrectly identified as anomalies.\n",
    "True Negatives (TN): Normal instances correctly identified as normal.\n",
    "False Negatives (FN): Anomalies incorrectly identified as normal.\n",
    "Common metrics:\n",
    "Precision: TP/ (TP+FP) \n",
    "Recall (Sensitivity): TP/ (TP+FN) \n",
    "F1-score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.\n",
    "Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC-ROC): Measures the trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q3. DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise):\n",
    "\n",
    "DBSCAN is a density-based clustering algorithm.\n",
    "It groups together data points that are close to each other and have a sufficient number of neighbors, forming dense regions separated by sparser areas.\n",
    "It classifies points as core, border, or noise based on their density.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q4. Epsilon Parameter in DBSCAN:\n",
    "\n",
    "The epsilon parameter (ε) represents the maximum distance between two data points for one to be considered as in the neighborhood of the other.\n",
    "It directly affects the size of the neighborhood and, therefore, the clusters formed.\n",
    "Choosing an appropriate ε is critical for the algorithm's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q5. Core, Border, and Noise Points in DBSCAN:\n",
    "\n",
    "Core Points: Have at least a specified number of points (minPts) within their ε-neighborhood.\n",
    "Border Points: Have fewer than minPts within their ε-neighborhood but belong to the neighborhood of a core point.\n",
    "Noise Points: Have fewer than minPts within their ε-neighborhood and are not part of the neighborhood of a core point.\n",
    "In anomaly detection, noise points are often considered anomalies.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q6. DBSCAN for Anomaly Detection:\n",
    "\n",
    "Anomalies can be identified as noise points or border points, as they deviate from the dense regions.\n",
    "Key parameters:\n",
    "ε (maximum distance for neighbors).\n",
    "minPts (minimum number of points to form a dense region).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q7. make_circles in scikit-learn:\n",
    "\n",
    "The make_circles function generates a large circle containing a smaller circle in two-dimensional space.\n",
    "Useful for testing clustering and classification algorithms, especially those that struggle with non-linearly separable data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q8. Local Outliers vs. Global Outliers:\n",
    "\n",
    "Local Outliers: Deviate from the norm in their local neighborhood.\n",
    "Global Outliers: Deviate globally across the entire dataset.\n",
    "Local outliers may not be noticeable when considering the entire dataset, and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q9. Detecting Local Outliers with LOF:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Local Outlier Factor (LOF) computes the local density deviation of a data point relative to its neighbors.\n",
    "Points with a significantly lower density compared to their neighbors are considered local outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q10. Detecting Global Outliers with Isolation Forest:\n",
    "- The Isolation Forest isolates anomalies by randomly selecting features and building trees.\n",
    "- Anomalies are identified as instances with shorter average path lengths in the trees, indicating they are easier to isolate.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q11. Applications of Local vs. Global Outlier Detection:\n",
    "- Local Outlier Detection:\n",
    "- Fraud detection in credit card transactions (local anomalies in spending behavior).\n",
    "- Intrusion detection in computer networks (local anomalies in network traffic).\n",
    "- Global Outlier Detection:\n",
    "- Manufacturing quality control (global anomalies in product defects).\n",
    "- Environmental monitoring (global anomalies in pollution levels)."
